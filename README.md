# Password Generator

## Description
The Password Generator project written in Django is a web application that generates secure and random passwords for users. The application allows users to select the length of the password, as well as the types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) to include in the generated password. The project is built using Django, a Python-based web framework, and incorporates the Django Forms and Random modules to generate secure passwords. The application is designed to be easy to use and helps users to create strong passwords to protect their accounts and sensitive information.
